# Ethical Guidelines for GeoSense Platform

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-01  
**Status:** Research Use Only

## Purpose

This document outlines ethical principles and guidelines for the development and use of the GeoSense geophysical sensing and mapping platform.

## Research Use Declaration

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This platform is currently designated for **RESEARCH USE ONLY**. It is not approved for:
- Operational military applications
- Commercial surveillance
- Privacy-invasive monitoring
- Unauthorized territory mapping
- Any use that violates international treaties or national laws

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Scientific Integrity
- All measurements and analyses must be conducted with scientific rigor
- Data processing methods must be transparent and reproducible
- Results must be reported honestly, including uncertainties and limitations
- Peer review and independent validation are encouraged

### 2. Dual-Use Awareness
Space-based gravimetry has legitimate scientific applications but also potential dual-use concerns:

**Approved Applications:**
- Climate change research (ice sheet mass balance, sea level rise)
- Hydrological studies (groundwater depletion, aquifer mapping)
- Solid earth geophysics (earthquake precursors, mantle convection)
- Natural resource management (sustainable development)
- Environmental monitoring (ecosystem health)

**Prohibited Applications:**
- Unauthorized surveillance of sovereign territories
- Military targeting or intelligence gathering without proper authorization
- Violation of international space law or Earth observation treaties
- Privacy violations of individuals or communities

### 3. Data Privacy and Security

**Data Classification:**
- Raw gravity measurements: Open science data (when authorized)
- Processed mass distribution maps: Requires review before publication
- High-resolution results over sensitive areas: Restricted access

**Access Controls:**
- Multi-factor authentication for system access
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for data and processing capabilities
- Audit logging of all data access and processing operations
- Encryption at rest and in transit

### 4. International Cooperation
- Respect for the Outer Space Treaty (1967) principles
- Compliance with UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS)
- Coordination with international Earth observation frameworks
- Data sharing with scientific community (where appropriate)

### 5. Environmental Responsibility
- Minimize space debris through responsible satellite operations
- Follow end-of-life disposal guidelines
- Consider environmental impact of ground infrastructure

## Specific Use Case Evaluations

Before deploying GeoSense capabilities for any new application, conduct an ethical review addressing:

1. **Scientific Necessity**: Is this the best method for the research question?
2. **Alternative Methods**: Have less intrusive methods been considered?
3. **Stakeholder Impact**: Who will be affected and how?
4. **Legal Compliance**: Does this comply with all applicable laws?
5. **Dual-Use Risk**: Could this be misused? What safeguards exist?

## Data Sharing Principles

### Open Science Commitment
- Default to open publication of scientifically valuable datasets
- Provide documented data formats and processing code
- Share models and algorithms with research community

### Responsible Disclosure
- Review high-resolution data before publication
- Consult with relevant authorities for sensitive regions
- Implement appropriate time delays for real-time data when necessary

## Governance Structure

**Ethics Committee (To Be Established):**
- Independent scientific advisors
- Legal experts in space law
- Representatives from affected communities
- Policy specialists

**Responsibilities:**
- Review new use cases
- Investigate ethical concerns
- Recommend policy updates
- Annual ethics audit

## Compliance and Reporting

### Internal Compliance
- Regular training on ethical guidelines for all team members
- Ethics considerations in design review process
- Documented decision-making for sensitive applications

### External Reporting
- Annual transparency report on platform usage
- Disclosure of any dual-use concerns identified
- Cooperation with regulatory inquiries

## Questions and Concerns

If you have ethical concerns about any use of the GeoSense platform:

1. **Internal Team**: Contact the project ethics lead
2. **External Researchers**: Submit concerns to ethics@geosense.example
3. **Anonymous**: Use the ethics reporting hotline (to be established)

## Acknowledgment

All users and developers of the GeoSense platform must acknowledge and agree to these ethical guidelines before accessing the system.
