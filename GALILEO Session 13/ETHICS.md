- **Do No Harm**: Systems must minimize risks of harm to individuals and society
- **Risk Assessment**: Continuous evaluation of potential negative impacts
- **Safety First**: Prioritize safety over performance or efficiency

### 3. Justice and Fairness
- **Equitable Access**: Benefits should be distributed fairly
- **Fair Treatment**: Consistent and unbiased treatment of all users
- **Accountability**: Clear responsibility for system outcomes
- **Redress Mechanisms**: Processes for addressing grievances

### 4. Compliance and Integrity
- **Legal Compliance**: Adherence to all applicable laws and regulations

   - Biometric authentication in sensitive contexts
   - Must assess privacy and consent implications

4. **Automated Decision-Making**
   - Systems affecting employment, credit, or benefits
   - Criminal justice or legal applications
   - Healthcare diagnosis or treatment decisions
   - Educational assessment and placement

### Level 2: Standard Review Required

1. **Personal Data Processing**
   - Collection and analysis of personal information
   - Profiling and predictive analytics
   - Cross-platform data aggregation
   - Must comply with data protection regulations

2. **Research with Vulnerable Populations**
   - Studies involving minors
   - Research with cognitively impaired individuals
   - Studies of economically disadvantaged groups
   - Requires additional safeguards and oversight

3. **Health and Medical Applications**

- Identification of potential ethical concerns
- Stakeholder analysis and impact assessment

### 2. Ethics Committee Review
- Independent review by qualified ethics committee
- For restricted research areas
- Multidisciplinary evaluation
- Risk-benefit analysis

### 3. Ongoing Monitoring
- Regular progress reviews
- Incident reporting and investigation
- Adaptation to new ethical concerns
- Annual comprehensive audits

### 4. Post-Research Evaluation
- Assessment of outcomes against predictions
- Identification of lessons learned
- Publication of ethical considerations (where appropriate)
- Long-term impact monitoring
